### Project Overview

**JavaDroid IDE** is a modern, lightweight, and offline-first Integrated Development Environment for writing and running basic Java code, built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It is designed to provide a seamless coding experience on any device, from a desktop browser to a mobile phone, without requiring an internet connection or a powerful backend. The entire application runs on the client, embracing an "offline-first" philosophy that ensures your projects are always accessible, private, and instantly available.

This project leverages a cutting-edge technical stack, including **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **React**, and **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe foundation. The UI is crafted with the elegant and accessible **ShadCN UI** component library, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive design. The core PWA functionality is powered by `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`, enabling native-like installation, offline capabilities, and a truly integrated user experience.

The primary goal of JavaDroid IDE is to democratize coding by removing common barriers. It empowers developers and learners to write Java **anywhere, anytime, without needing high-end hardware or a persistent internet connection**. By storing all projects directly in the browser's local storage, the app guarantees user privacy and delivers a zero-latency workflow, making it the perfect tool for quick prototyping, learning on the go, or coding in environments with limited connectivity.
